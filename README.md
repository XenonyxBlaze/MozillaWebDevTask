# MozillaWebDevTask

Backend and Frontend for the mozilla firefox club registration

## How To Run

Open a terminal and enter the following commands:

> pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the packages that the app needs

> cd mozillaBackend
> py manage.py runserver

Now in a browser enter this url:
<a href='127.0.0.1:8000'>127.0.0.1:8000</a>

### NOTE: This is a development build so currently it only has the backend configured and I ran out of time for fully creating a proper frontend
